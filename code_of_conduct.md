# Rules

- Be nice to each other. Respect other developers, contributors, users, etc.
- Don't cause drama, make chaos, try to vandalize the repo, hate other persons based on their nationality, age, etc. Noone cares who you are and what is your identity. What matters is the quality of your input, and this defines you in the context of this project. Also don't waste time discussing the previous sentence.
- Respect the licence. We will anyway eventually find out you pirated or disassembled some still-copyrighted code or violated the licence in some other way. Don't drag us poor souls to the court with mighty corporations.
- No hate and insults towards tildearrow, will result in a ban everywhere `[TBD: Discord server??]` and closing writing access to this repo (if hater has it).
